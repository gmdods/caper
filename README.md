# Caper
An attempt at a compile-time C.

## Building

The bootstrap implementation is in Julia.
_In future_:
There will be a Caper to C translator and a self-hosted compiler.
The generated C translation of the compiler could build Caper in any system (with libc).

## Language Syntax

For now, we only describe the differences with C.

### Literals

Standard decimal With Lispy (also Julia and Elixir) compile-time
readers and [sigils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)#Literal_affixes).

```elixir
1, -2 # Nat, Int
b"10110", h"ffff" # Bits
f"1.0", f"-Inf", f"1e3" # Floats
char"a", utf"Ã©" # ASCII, UTF codepoint
re"\p{L}[\p{L}\p{N}]*\s+=\s+\p{N}+" # Regex
fmt"%s = %u;" # Format
```

## Declarations

Variable declarations are similar to Fortran.
Type specification are always value-first.

```c
int :: delta = 0; // equiv. int :: delta; delta = 0;
int^ :: ptr = nil;
int[3] :: array = {0, 1, 2};
int^(int, int) :: fn = add;
:: mask = h"ff"; // auto
```
