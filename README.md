# Caper
An attempt at a compile-time C.

## Building

The bootstrap implementation is in Julia.
_In future_:
There will be a Caper to C translator and a self-hosted compiler.
The generated C translation of the compiler could build Caper in any system (with libc).

## Language Syntax

For now, we only describe the differences with C.

### Literals

Standard decimal With Lispy (also Julia and Elixir) compile-time
readers and [sigils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)#Literal_affixes).

Sigils are case-insensitive.

```elixir
1, -2 # Nat, Int
b'10110', h'ffff' # Bits
f'1.0', f'-Inf', f'1e3' # Floats
char'a', utf'Ã©' # ASCII, UTF codepoint
Re'\p{L}[\p{L}\p{N}]*\s+=\s+\p{N}+' # Regex
Fmt"%s = %u;" # Format
D"2000-01-01", T"12:00:01" # Date Time
```

## Declarations

Variable declarations are similar to Fortran (with ':' instead of '::').
Type specification are always value-first (in contrast with Rust, Zig, Odin, Jai, etc.).

```c
int : delta = 0; // equiv. int : delta; delta = 0;
int^ : ptr = nil;
int[3] : array = {0, 1, 2};
int^(int, int) : fn = add;
: mask = h"ff"; // auto
```

## Functions

```c
void(byte_t[_], byte_t[_], size_t) : memcpy = fn (: src; : dst; : nbytes;) {
    for (; nbytes > 0; nbytes -= 1) {
        dst[nbytes] = src[nbytes];
    }
}
```
